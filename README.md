The two projects aim towards helping an investor analyse and trade stocks. 

The first project aims towards building an automated system where the user can choose the stocks they would like to analyse and the time period and the output would return additive and multiplicative decompostion of the time series. 

This second project aims to build a model to predict buy and sell signals for ICICI bank stocks. Two models built were random forest and cart models based on MACD and Bollinger band indicators.
